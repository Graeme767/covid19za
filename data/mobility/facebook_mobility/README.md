# Facebook Movement Range Maps for South Africa (ZAF)

Data collected from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/movement-range-maps

## Summary

These data sets are intended to inform researchers and public health experts about how populations are responding to physical distancing measures. In particular, there are two metrics, Change in Movement and Stay Put, that provide a slightly different perspective on movement trends. Change in Movement looks at how much people are moving around and compares it with a baseline period that predates most social distancing measures, while Stay Put looks at the fraction of the population that appear to stay within a small area during an entire day.
