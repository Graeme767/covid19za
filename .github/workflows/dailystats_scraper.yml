# The NICD data is release typically between 18:00 and 20:00.  Run this every 5 mins between those times   
# Adjusted to GMT+0 times
# This runner takes some time to setup, if we need to install R first.  

# test this locally by using the "act" tool:  https://github.com/nektos/act
# need to download the "full" version of the image, as R is not installed in the medium image.
# docker pull catthehacker/ubuntu:full-20.04
# act -j dailystats_scrape
# check the ~/.actrc file for mappings between ubuntu-20.04 and the full or medium images....
